What is this app? 
I created a React app that clones the Reddit feed using its Api. It has a simple and direct UX so it's easy to search and read articles.

How it works? 
It gets its data from the api, displays it into the page creating a feed of article directly from a chosen subreddit. You can chose the subreddit by searching its name the search bar and it will automatically change the articles into the latest ones in the selected subreddit.
After clicking on an article it takes you to its reddit post directly in a new tab.
